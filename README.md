`Github username`

## Requirements for the assignment

- If the command entered by the user is *not* a built in command, ask the hosting operating system (Linux) if it belongs to it.  For example, `ping` is *not* a built-in command so you will need to ask Linux if it belongs to it.
- If the command belongs to Linux execute the command and return the output.
- If the command does *not* belong to Linux return a **descriptive** error message to the user.
